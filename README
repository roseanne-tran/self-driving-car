INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE

1. LANE DETECTION
Require: OpenCV
Navigate to the Lane-Detection directory and run the following command line:
$ python3 detect_lanes.py
(press 'q' on the keyboard to quit the video)

2. TRAFFIC SIGN PREDICTION
Require: Keras and OpenCV
Navigate to the Traffic_signs folder
To view the process of training the model, import Traffic_Sign_Model.ipynb to Google Colab. Drag data.zip,labels.csv, slippery-road(23).jpg, and yield(13).jpg to the file upload on the left. The run all cells.

To test the traffic sign images using webcam camera, run the following command line:
$ python3 traffic-detection.py 
The folder images contains images the model has not seen. To test the model, hold the images to the webcam camera.

3. COLLISION PREVENTION
Require: TensorFlow and TensorFlow Object Detection API
Instruction to install the TensorFlow Object Detection API can be found at 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md

Navigate to the Collision-prevention folder, and run the following command line:
$ python3 collision_detection.py
